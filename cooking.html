  <h2>Cooking the Brisket</h2>
  <p>Cooking brisket is all about low and slow. Rushing it will leave you with a dry, tough cut of meat — but if you’re patient, you’ll end up with something tender, smoky, and worth every minute. Whether you’re using a smoker, an oven, or even a slow cooker, the goal is steady heat and time to break down all that connective tissue and fat.</p>

  <p>If you’re smoking the brisket (which is the traditional way), aim for a temperature of around <strong>225°F</strong>. You’ll want to plan for about <strong>1 to 1.5 hours of cook time per pound</strong>, so a 14-pound brisket could take anywhere from 14 to 20 hours. Keep your wood mild — oak, hickory, or pecan are great — and try to maintain consistent heat throughout the cook.</p>

  <p>About halfway through the cook, you’ll hit what’s called the “stall,” where the internal temp plateaus around 150–170°F. Don’t panic. You can either power through or wrap the brisket in butcher paper or foil (known as the “Texas Crutch”) to push it through the stall a little faster and help retain moisture. I personally like to do a foil boat which is a mixture of wrapping in butcher paper and aluminum foil.  I'll lay out multiple pieces of aluminum foild when the meat is around 170 or so.  Towards the end of the stall.  Then I'll lay the brisket down and curl the foil up just around all the corners of the brisket.  From the point most of the rendered fat escaping the brisket is caught in the foil where the meat almost confits (cooks in its own fat) for the remainder of the cook.</p>

  <p>The brisket is done when the internal temperature hits between <strong>195–205°F</strong>, but more importantly, when a thermometer probe or skewer slides in like butter. When it’s done, remove it from the heat and let it <strong>rest for at least an hour</strong>. This allows the juices to redistribute and keeps it moist when slicing.</p>

  <p>Cooking brisket takes time, but the end result — that deep bark, smoky flavor, and tender slices — is worth every bit of effort.</p>
