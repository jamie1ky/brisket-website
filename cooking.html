  <h2>Cooking the Brisket</h2>
  <p>Cooking brisket is all about low and slow. Rushing it will leave you with a dry, tough cut of meat — but if you’re patient, you’ll end up with something tender, smoky, and worth every minute. Whether you’re using a smoker, an oven, or even a slow cooker, the goal is steady heat and time to break down all that connective tissue and fat.</p>

  <p>If you’re smoking the brisket (which is the traditional way), aim for a temperature of around <strong>225°F</strong>. You’ll want to plan for about <strong>1 to 1.5 hours of cook time per pound</strong>, so a 14-pound brisket could take anywhere from 14 to 20 hours. Keep your wood mild — oak, hickory, or pecan are great — and try to maintain consistent heat throughout the cook.</p>

  <p>About halfway through the cook, you’ll hit what’s called the “stall,” where the internal temp plateaus around 150–170°F. Don’t panic. You can either power through or wrap the brisket in butcher paper or foil (known as the “Texas Crutch”) to push it through the stall a little faster and help retain moisture.</p>

  <p>The brisket is done when the internal temperature hits between <strong>195–205°F</strong>, but more importantly, when a thermometer probe or skewer slides in like butter. When it’s done, remove it from the heat and let it <strong>rest for at least an hour</strong>. This allows the juices to redistribute and keeps it moist when slicing.</p>

  <p>Cooking brisket takes time, but the end result — that deep bark, smoky flavor, and tender slices — is worth every bit of effort.</p>
