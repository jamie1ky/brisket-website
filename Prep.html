  <h2>Prepping the Brisket</h2>
  <p>Prepping a brisket is where the magic starts. It’s not just about tossing meat on a smoker—getting the trim and seasoning right is what sets up a tender, flavorful result that folks will talk about for days. In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to choose the right brisket at the store, how much fat to trim, and what kind of seasoning works best depending on your cooking style.</p>

  <p>You don’t need fancy gear or secret rubs—just a sharp knife, some patience, and a little know-how. Whether you're trimming a 15-pound packer down to size or keeping it simple with salt and pepper, this page will help you get your brisket prepped and ready for a slow, smoky cook.</p>

  <p>Now when it comes to prepping a brisket, there are a lot of opinions out there.  You could not trim the brisket, and risk having a ton of fat that will never render down.  You'll have a significant fat layer on the brisket that would not be very pleasing to the pallet.  The rule of thumb is to trim the fat cap (layer of fat on top of brisket) to about a 1/4 inch.  That's the sweet spot.  If your trimming and you accidentally expose some meat below the fat, no problem.  Also, cut off any sharp edges and anything too thin and will burn.  And trust me, anything thinner than an inch to an inch and half will burn during the roughly 15 hour cook.  In the end I'll usually cut 3 to 4 pounds of fat and other trimming off the brisket.  Don't worry.  You can use the cuttings for burgers or just render down the fat for other cooking purposes.</p>

  <p>Seasoning.  Wow.  It's endless.  Watch any BBQ show and you will quickly find that there are as many superstitions and myths as anything else in this world.  Some people use binders like mustard or some kind of oil and other simply use salt and pepper.  Binders are meant to help the real rockstar of this show to adhere to the meat while also adding another layer of flavor.  I personally think it's best to keep it simple and let the meat shine through.  Here we only use salt and pepper.  Specifically, 2 parts pepper to 1 part salt.  Whisk it together and literally soak your brisket in it and shake off the excess.  I know it sounds crazy but that is a massive piece of meat and the 2 parts pepper keeps you from over salting the meat.  A lot of the sought after bark we crave comes from the pepper as well.  This is Texas style and they've pretty much crushed the competition for decades.</p>

  <p>When it's all said and done, you should have something that looks similar to the brisket below.
