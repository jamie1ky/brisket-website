  <h2>Serving and Storing</h2>
  <p>After all the time and care you put into cooking that brisket, serving it the right way makes a big difference. Once it's had time to rest, transfer the brisket to a cutting board and take a minute to identify the grain of the meat. Always slice <strong>against the grain</strong> — this shortens the muscle fibers and gives you tender, easy-to-chew slices. Use a long, sharp slicing knife and aim for slices about the thickness of a pencil.</p>

  <p>The point and flat muscles have different grain directions, so you may need to adjust your slicing angle as you go. If you’re serving a crowd, arrange the slices neatly on a tray and consider brushing a little of the rendered juices or beef tallow over the top for extra flavor and shine.</p>

  <p>Pair your brisket with classic sides like baked beans, mac and cheese, coleslaw, or cornbread. Pickles and sliced onions make great palate cleansers and are often served with Texas-style brisket.</p>

  <p>Got leftovers? Brisket stores beautifully. Wrap slices tightly in foil or plastic wrap, then place them in an airtight container. It will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days. For longer storage, brisket also freezes well — just make sure it’s double-wrapped to prevent freezer burn. To reheat, go low and slow again: use your oven or a covered skillet over low heat to avoid drying it out.</p>

  <p>Great brisket is just as satisfying the next day and several days to come.  Hopefully once it's done you'll have something tender and delicious.</p>
